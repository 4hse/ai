# 4HSE System Workflow Guide

## Overview

The 4HSE system manages health, safety, security, and environmental (HSE) requirements through a structured workflow involving actions, subscriptions, certificates, and their relationships.

## Core Entities and Concepts

### 1. Actions
**Actions** are the foundation of the 4HSE system. They represent requirements that can be assigned to people or resources:

- **Training Courses** (`TRAINING`) - Educational requirements like "General Worker Training" or "VDT Usage Training"
- **Maintenance Plans** (`MAINTENANCE`) - Scheduled maintenance activities for equipment
- **Health Surveillance Plans** (`HEALTH`) - Medical monitoring and health checks
- **Procedures** (`CHECK`) - Safety procedures and emergency protocols
- **Individual Protection Plans** (`PER`) - Personal protective equipment requirements

**Tool**: Use `create_4hse_action` to add new training courses, maintenance plans, procedures, etc.

### 2. Action Subscriptions (The "Need")
**Action Subscriptions** represent the assignment of requirements to specific people or resources. They create the "need" that must be satisfied:

- Links a person or resource to an action requirement
- Establishes that someone needs training, equipment needs maintenance, etc.
- Creates the requirement that must later be resolved by a certificate

**Tool**: Use `create_4hse_action_subscription` to assign requirements to people or resources.

### 3. Certificates (The "Resolution")
**Certificates** prove that requirements have been satisfied:

- Evidence that training was completed, maintenance was performed, etc.
- Specify coverage periods (from issue date to expiration date)
- Target specific people or resources
- "Resolve" the needs created by action subscriptions

**Tool**: Use `create_4hse_certificate` to document completed training, maintenance, etc.

### 4. Certificate-Action Associations (The "Link")
**Certificate-Action** relationships specify exactly which action requirements a certificate satisfies:

- Links certificates to specific actions
- Completes the requirement resolution workflow
- May have different expiration dates than the certificate itself

**Tool**: Use `create_4hse_certificate_action` to link certificates to specific actions.

### 5. Demands (Alternative Requirements)
**Demands** represent a different type of requirement relationship:

- Similar to action subscriptions but for specific requests or demands
- Used for particular scenarios where standard subscriptions don't apply

**Tool**: Use `create_4hse_demand` for specific requirement requests.

## Typical Workflows

### Adding Training Courses to a Project

**Scenario**: You want to add training courses like "General Worker Training" and "VDT Usage Training" to a project location.

**Correct Workflow**:
1. **Create Actions** (the training courses) using `create_4hse_action` with `actionType: "TRAINING"`
2. **Create Action Subscriptions** to assign these courses to specific people using `create_4hse_action_subscription`
3. **Create Certificates** when training is completed using `create_4hse_certificate`
4. **Link Certificates to Actions** using `create_4hse_certificate_action`

**❌ Common Mistake**: Using `create_4hse_certificate` directly to "add courses" - certificates don't create courses, they certify completion of existing courses.

### Equipment Maintenance Workflow

**Scenario**: Setting up maintenance requirements for equipment.

**Correct Workflow**:
1. **Create Action** (maintenance plan) using `create_4hse_action` with `actionType: "MAINTENANCE"`
2. **Create Action Subscription** to assign maintenance to specific equipment using `create_4hse_action_subscription`
3. **Create Certificate** when maintenance is performed using `create_4hse_certificate`
4. **Link Certificate to Action** using `create_4hse_certificate_action`

## Entity Relationships

```
Action (Training Course, Maintenance Plan, etc.)
    ↓
Action-Subscription (Assigns requirement to person/resource)
    ↓ (creates need)
Certificate (Proves completion/satisfaction)
    ↓
Certificate-Action (Links certificate to specific action)
```

## Key Principles

1. **Actions First**: Always create the action (course, plan, procedure) before assigning it
2. **Subscriptions Create Needs**: Action subscriptions establish what's required
3. **Certificates Resolve Needs**: Certificates prove requirements have been met
4. **Linking Completes Workflow**: Certificate-action associations specify exactly what was satisfied

## Tool Selection Guide

| Task | Correct Tool | Wrong Tool |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Add training courses to project | `create_4hse_action` | `create_4hse_certificate` |
| Assign training to person | `create_4hse_action_subscription` | `create_4hse_certificate` |
| Record training completion | `create_4hse_certificate` | `create_4hse_action` |
| Link certificate to course | `create_4hse_certificate_action` | N/A |

## Action Types Reference

- **TRAINING**: Educational courses, certifications, skill development
- **MAINTENANCE**: Equipment servicing, inspections, repairs
- **HEALTH**: Medical surveillance, health monitoring, occupational health
- **CHECK**: Procedures, protocols, safety checks, audits
- **PER**: Personal protective equipment, individual safety measures

Remember: The workflow always starts with creating the action (the requirement), then assigning it (creating the need), then satisfying it (creating certificates), and finally linking them (completing the resolution).
